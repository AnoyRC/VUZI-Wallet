## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://www.myvuzi.com/)

Navigating crypto wallets can be tricky. But not with Vuzi! We're all about making it simple and super secure.

Managing wallets is about more than just remembering a bunch of words. It's like a dance between you, your assets, and those blockchain networks. We make sure it's a smooth dance, not a complicated one.

Our pitch is straightforward: we simplify crypto wallet management, making it a breeze for your users. No more headaches, just a secure and user-friendly experience. Let's make crypto wallets easy for everyone in this ever-changing landscape!

Here are some cool features of Vuzi:

*  **Seedless Wallet**  Generate crypto wallets without a public key, Private key pair, or any 12 work passwords you must remember.
* **onChain 2FA** Protect your wallet with our onChain 2FA module powered by Passkeys.
* **Crosschain*  Interact with any EVM chain. You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
* *Web2 login** login to your web3 wallet with the comfort of your web2 accounts. 

Of course, a simple, smart wallet will only serve some of your needs. Vuzi is a modular wallet infrastructure where you can deploy user wallets using our SDK.

## Who needs Vuzi Infra?
* web3 Game development: User Vuzi wallets in your game to securely store in-game assists for your users.
* Crypto Art galleries: Do you want your users not to worry about wallets, when all they want is to buy cute crypto kitties?
* DeSo: anyone who is building the next x alternative or friendTech, deploy wallets with custom logics faster with Vuzi. 

Pro tip Vuzi stands for ''Easy'' in web3 language.
